To determine whether an index has it's stats updated we can run the following command:
 
DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS (table_name , index_name)
 
To Update the Stats on a table the following command can be run :
 
UPDATE STATISTICS <table name> WITH FULLSCAN
 
The above command will scan all the rows of the table to get the updated statistics.
   
UPDATE STATISTICS <table name> WITH SAMPLE 50 PERCENT
  
The above script can be run for very large tables in case we want to specify a percentage of the total no of rows.
 
 
We should also update statistics for all tables in a database when we are upgrading from any version to a higher SQL Server version. 



EX:
-------------------------
sp_help 'Emp'

DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS (Emp , NC_NU_Emp_MgrID)
UPDATE STATISTICS Emp WITH SAMPLE 50 PERCENT

UPDATE STATISTICS Emp WITH FULLSCAN
